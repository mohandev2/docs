  <title>HPI B Specification</title>
  <sect1>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      OpenHPI 2.0 will be based on the HPI B specification (currently
      revision B.1.1 at the time of this writing).  The HPI B spec is
      seen by the industry as a dramatic improvement over the HPI A
      spec.  It includes many new concepts such as the Domain Alarm
      Table, Annuciators, and a simplified domain model.
    </para>
    <para>
      Unfortunately these changes are extensive enough that HPI B
      isn't source or binarily compatible with HPI A.  This document
      will provide some information in addressing porting from HPI A
      to HPI B as it addresses specific changes between the two
      specifications.

    <title>Interpretations</title>
    <para>
      This section should include any interpretations made during the
      course of implementing the specification so that it can be well
      documented for future reference.
